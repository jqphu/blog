## Notes
* I guess in mid-may (Sprint 5) I'll go back to AUS? After I get vaccinated?
* It is now the middle of the half. With planning, we take a look at our P0's and see what we're
  going to miss / adjust. The north star we wrote out feels really far away :P. Feels like more of
  the same 2020H2. This probably means we need an adjustment!
  * As much as I hate it, I am going to put Mindless on
    the back burner. Need to be more efficient and focused before I pick up new items.
  * Rework "Wake Up Consistency Score >80(?)" to "Readiness score >80". I have found the Wake Up
    Consistency is not a useful metric.
  * For the rest of April it's a routine focused sprint.

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block
* Track this in Daily Notes!

## [P1] KR: Sleep score >80 and Readiness Score >80.
* Sleep score has been close to 80! Been sleeping a ton and not staying up late :D

## [P1] KR: 90 sessions of meditation.
* We're on the tipping point of this. Keep it up!

## [P2] KR: Complete the morning/night routine for 90 times
* We've started to do this a little in march.
