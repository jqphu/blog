> It's 10pm and the day is winding down. You've been thinking about this one problem all day and you
can't get it out of your head. You think you have the whole picture in your head and your body is
telling you to write it down. You know you have a meeting early tomorrow but it can't wait. You pour
yourself a coffee, get yourself in a state of flow and get it done. This experience of solving
something that you've worked hard for is almost euphoric. Finishing the problem you check the clock
and it's 2am. You quickly head to bed. The alarm rings the next day and you drag yourself out of
bed. You're physically there for meetings and discussions but your mind is half asleep. You fuel
yourself with more coffee but productivity for the day has been destroyed.


You ahve the whole You're in the middle of solving this one problem. You're in a state of flow. You have the complete picture
of the problem in your head you just need more time to finish it.
