title: Sprint Planning - October

October sprint is going to be a little shorter ending on 2020-10-31. Since we're nearing the end of
this half this half we will stay true to the theme of the half which is laying the foundations.

The goal of this sprint will be **foundations**.

## Events
* Might take a single day off somewhere.
  * Not entirely confident on this one, might want to save up my leave to go back to Australia.
* Attempting to move more of my messenger conversations to video calls. Not sure how this will go
  but I'm always down to experiment.

### Australia?
Original plan was to go back to Australia end of this sprint. A few complications have turned up.
* Can't seem to find non-stop flights from SFO to SYD. Only option is 1 stop in Vancouver totaling
  21 hr flight time + 3 hour stop. I hate flying as is already but if this were the only
  complication I'd be okay.
* 14 day quarantine is now in a hotel.
  * Cost of $3000 AUD
  * Not sure whether or not I can work. <- this is the main deal-breaker

As much as I'd love to go to COVID free Sydney and spend Christmas with my family this is a pretty
hefty price to place. Along with I shouldn't be travelling anyway. I will wait to hear from FB to
see if AWA gets extended or not since at this point I don't think it's worth it to go back then fly
back to SF by EOY. The increased travel is not worth the risk.

Tentatively, delay going back to Aus until Jan / Feb when things are hopefully a bit better. This
means I'll start saving up my paid leave at FB since I might not be able to use my AWA.

## Theme

The theme of the sprint will be foundations. Although, in the half KR I put being consistent with
mindless are a very key overall goal I think we need to handle some tech debt first. I think the
major mistake I've been making trying to build my habits is trying to build habits whilst also doing
something else. Therefore, this sprint we are going to focus entirely on habits.

Here are the ordered KRs based on relative importance.

# [P0] Key Result 1: Develop a consistent sleeping pattern
My arch nemesis - sleep. I very much value sleep, almost too much. Leave me be and I will sleep 12
hours straight. Anything less than 9 hours of sleep I will start to feel grumpy. Last sprint sleep
was not a priority and it utterly ruined my productivity and mood.

**Success Criteria: Sleep within 1 hour of of 9pm.**

It feels so stupid that I have to write this goal down. Feels like I'm talking to a child.  However,
that's the whole point. Making the success criteria so simple that even a child can understand
removes the chances for excuses or wiggle room. Thinking as if you were a person that was
responsible for taking care of yourself what guidelines would you put in place.

I'm not doing anything crazy like I used to which is waking up at 4am (or even 2am). We want
something consistent and stable. Waking up at 6am will allow me to do my morning routine before
tennis or exercise at ~7am.

This does mean saying no to any activity that takes me out over 9pm (in fact over 8pm due to night
routine). Typically, this would be pretty bad for my social life but with COVID I'm not going out
anyway. We're going to have to be a bit more sensitive with our time here and be prepared to say no
or reschedule (which I am always so bad at).

# [P1] Key Result 2: Morning and Night Routines
Self explanatory. Let's get this routine up and running.

I have a whiteboard with the days + the routine goals.

**Success Criteria: Miss fewer than 1 / 6 routine goals per week.**

As I say every time I try to stick to a routine:  I have a good feeling about this! 

# [P1] Key Result 3: Reading

This should simply fall in using my night routine. Calling it out explicitly anyway.

**Success Criteria: Finish Essentialism + write a post it.**

I was going to add finish two books but its a shorter sprint.

# [P0] Key Result 1: Execute on Critical Features
As our main goal we will stick to work as our focus. Let's get the routine in place and then start
slotting in more mindless development.

**Success Criteria: Execute on work plan. This means don't sign up for more than you can chew.**

Bit of a subjective exit criteria but I guess that's the nature of the work.

# [P0] Key Result 1: Exercise
We're ramping this one up a little. I want to move to start the day, nothing intense like tennis,
but some kind of simple movement (yoga, quick walk/run around the block, core work). This should
align with the goal of stability (e.g. if tennis gets cut out of the equation it doesn't mean I have
no other way to exercise).

**Success Criteria: Some kind of movement 5 days a week (tennis will fill 3 days, meaning something misc
for 2 days)**

## [P1] Key Result 3: Reflecting (Mental Health)
Journal + Meditation. As with my physical health I need to continue to exercise my brain.

**Success Criteria: Daily journaling and meditation.**

# Summary
A little bit of a lean plan this sprint. Partially because it's a shorter sprint but also partially
to keep lazer focused. We much rather execute 110% on a few plans than 70% on many.

Looking forward to a great month!
