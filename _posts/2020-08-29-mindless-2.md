# Cheating On Your Exams

If you ever asked me how do you do well in university exams my answer would be simple - cheat. Now I
don't mean the peek over at your neighbors assignment cheating but rather cheat the system. Let's
say you're two weeks out from your exam and you've been too busy getting drunk and making bad
decisions to go to classes. You have four courses and have no idea where to begin. The goal is
simple:

**Achieve the highest marks possible in our exams.**

Let's break down what I think the ideal strategy would be.

## Start From the End

Starting from the past-exams separate questions into three categories: Foundational, Required and
Curveball.

For example in a trivial mathematics exam you have these problems in the categories:

Foundational: Plug in numbers into the quadratic formula to find the roots
Required: Find the intercepts given a graph 
Curveball: A real life example where you have to deduce the variables

Questions in the foundational category will almost never change from year to year, questions in the
common might repeat every now and then and questions in the Curveball category vary wildly.

Given this distribution we want to invest our time into questions that are most likely to appear in
the exam. This means a majority of our time will be figuring out how to solve foundational
questions.

This technique can be further simplified to *focus on what has the most impact*. You could focus all
your time on the Curveball questions but the chances that what you practiced will appear in the exam
will be slim to none.

## Feedback Loop

Now that we know what to focus our time on how do we know when enough time was spent. For example,
there will be numerous questions in the Foundational category, how do we know when we've succeeded
with one category and we are ready to move onto the next.

The answer is a simple **feedback loop**. You need to provide an input (effort spent
learning), pass it through the black box (exam) and using the results re-adjust the input (more or
less effort). This feedback loop is essential to provide immediate feedback such that you don't
spend too much time on the wrong thing.

# Cheating On Your Software Engineering Project

You might be thinking "that's some pretty obvious advice Justin, thanks for nothing >:(" and you
wouldn't be wrong. However, it seems like the most obvious techniques reap the more rewards.

Let's see how this applies to the Mindless project. The goal is also quite simple:

**Enable people to be more aware of their time and choices.**

Let us refine this goal a little bit into a short term goal.

**Allow people to track where they are spending their time.**

Okay, with this in mind let's start from the end and figure out the type of problems we might
encounter.

## Start From the End

Foundational: Provide a simple interface to track time. Persistently store the persons data. Retrieve
the users data.
Required: Provide richer task categorization. Automate tracking process.
Curveball: Performance problems. Stability problems. Scaling problems. Accessibility problems.

Great! Now we can focus on the foundational problems since we know that will affect each and every
user. Once we have those down pact we can start expanding into the required category. We should
spend little to no effort on the curveballs until we are almost complete with required.

This categorisation can also be though of figuring out critical features which will make or break us
achieving the goal.

## Feedback Loop

Despite how confident we are that a certain technique might be usable at the end of the day the only
way to know is to feed it through the black box and see how it reacts. That is we cannot be heads
down building features without testing them out in the wild to validate our assumptions.

A rapid iteration cycle is very important to continually get feedback and continually understand
where time needs to be spent.

# A Reflection

The foundational problem that we have gone through multiple iterations on is figuring out the
interface to track time. Just like an exam question this is not about best effort, you either meet
the threshold and get it right or you get zero. The earlier approaches to use a FB chat bot and QR
codes resulted in feedback that allowed us to iterate and try new things. Using hackathons as a tool
for a quick set of iterations was essential here.

An area where we failed to take advantage of the feedback loop was attempting to store the persons
data. Multiple iterations were spent on this jumping between languages and databases. These provided
**zero** user facing value and we're addressing problems in the Required / Curveball categories.
There was no data to indicate that a re-work needed to be done.

Takeaway:
* Small fast iterations are important to validate assumptions to ensure you're going on the right
  path.
* Makes changes only if there is actionable feedback, otherwise this is wasted effort. 

# Mindless v0.0.1

Let's now evaluate the first iteration of this new project.

After setting up an app that e2e worked I decided I will use the application for a week to get a
feeling of what is usable and what isn't.

Here's where we got after a week. 

## App

### Feedback

Bad:
* The numbers underneath each category are close to useless. I cannot sort by day but get a
  cumulative time. After using this for a month these times will be absurd.
* Finding my task is hard. It's fine now but as I get more tasks I'm going to get lost. 

Good:
* Tracking tasks and adding tasks is simple. Simply, press play on what you want and the most recent
  tasks go to the top.

These concerns in the bad category were completely valid and need to be addressed. However, these
are more advanced foundational problems. As we will soon explore there we much more pressing issues
at hand!

## Calendar View

The more interesting usage than absolute numbers is to see what I spent my time on. Here is a
calendar day-to-day view of the app. I will only show the days that are interesting.

### Monday

There is a lot to unpack here.

1. Why did my night routine go until 4:30am? I guess I forgot to switch to the Sleep task.
2. I played tennis at 7am then I also played at 9:14am? That's a lot of tennis... (hint I did not
   play that much tennis).
3. Huge gaps?

#### Feedback

Turns out I had two major issues with the tracker.
* Task tracking did not work in the background meaning you had to keep the app open in the
  foreground. This made it absolutely unusable.
* It is easy to forget to track tasks...

The first problem was a technical problem which I can definitely solve. I went ahead and fixed that
to allow tracking with the app in the background. In fact I went a step further and allowed
continued tracking when the app wasn't even open.

### Wednesday

With the task tracking in the background fixed I was able to continually track my tasks! Interesting
information:

1. Tennis at 7:19am must have been a misclick.
2. Very coarse grained tasks.

#### Feedback

* There is no easy way to delete instances of tasks. This creates noise.
* **There is too much friction to starting new tasks**.

Okay, the first problem is definitely a real problem but its a quality of life problem. We punt this
problem off to the background. There is still a critical problem of not starting more tasks.

### Thursday

This was a uh... interesting day.

1. Looks like we really liked looking at memes. Don't tell my boss that that's what I did all day!
   In reality this was again likely me forgetting to switch back to work after taking a quick break.

#### Feedback

* Cannot edit events after the fact. In this scenario I saw that memes were running for >5 hours but
  I had no way to fix it and replace it with work.
* Still very coarse grained tasks.

## Overall Analysis

There are a bunch of problems to say the least, but the beauty of feedback is to be able to iterate
quickly and focus on the most important problems.

There are key quality of life issues like not having task categories, deleting tasks, editing tasks,
searching for tasks etc. These are absolutely important but they do not address the major concern.

**If there is no way for a seamless starting / finishing of tasks then the viability of the product
drops to zero.**

In terms of where to be spending our time, evaluating the viability of this technique is the utmost
importance.

# Action forward

The problem statement we need to solve is:

**Reduce the friction when changing tasks**

Here is the key insight that I tried to employ with QR codes but failed. **Tasks are almost always
location based.** If I'm going to sleep I'm going to be next to my bed, if I'm working I'll be at my
desk, if I'm eating I'll be at the kitchen etc. However, even with this key analysis QR codes did
not work due to the friction of having to open up the camera and click a link. We need to somehow
have less friction that opening up the camera application and scanning a QR code.

Assumptions:
* Needs to be less friction that scanning a QR code.
* Tasks are location based. 

In order to restrict the problem scope I focus on how this will work for me. Getting this to work in
the general case for everybody will be a completely different beast but if I can't use my own
product then it definitely has failed. Thus, we look into more intrusive approaches of tracking.

At this point the goal that I'm trying to achieve is an indoor positioning system. GPS won't work
due to the lack of granularity. These class of problems are called [Real-time locating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_locating_system).

Approaches:

## WiFi Positional Sensing

Using my WiFis router to determine where someone is also seems promising. However, this requires a
mesh network of multiple WiFis which is not suitable for room scale tracking.

## Motion Sensors

What's better than doing some work? Doing no work at all!

The first approach was to use motion sensors to detect when you transition into another state.
Having a motion sensor when I enter my bed or go into the kitchen.

Pros:
* Zero input whatsoever

Cons:
* Expensive.
* Requires somewhat non-trivial setup.

Risk:
* Fragile? How sensitive are these sensors? Will I get a lot of false positives or false negatives?

## Camera

Computer Vision is at a very impressive state and being able to detect where I am would be
incredibly useful.

Cons:
* Expensive
* Requires multiple cameras since one camera field of view will not be enough.
* Not sure I want a camera recording me 24/7 :) 

# The Next Iteration - NFC
At this point I realized getting a RTLS approach is too expensive. It also is overly complex for my use
case. I don't need consistent tracking but rather just need to determine the transition points.

Going back to my original problem with QR codes is the two steps to scan the code. What if you never
needed to use your camera to scan the QR code but there was a better way.

Here enters NFC tag, by scanning this from a NFC reader I would be able to track my next task.
This reduces the amount of steps to a single scan of my phone.  

Pros:
* Cheap - I can order heaps of these at little cost.
* Simple - no ML required, just a simple NFC chip to send a message to my app to then send a http
  request.

Cons:
* Still requires you to unlock your phone.
  * The good news is that you don't need the app active in the foreground to scan the chip.
    Therefore, in theory I can scan the chip and just use the fingerprint to unlock my phone without
    ever having to look at the screen.

Risk:
* How hard is it to reprogram the NFC tag? Can I embed reprogramming the tag into my app itself?

This seemed like the best approach of the bunch. It will allow us to validate the assumption that
tasks are mostly location based. We can expand on this idea later such that when we scan a NFC chip
the app opens up a fine grained view of what tasks can be done at that location. Best of both
worlds!

Furthermore, this doesn't just have to be location based but can be object based. I can start
sticking NFC tag on my gym bag to indicate I'm going to the gym or my bike if I'm going for a bike
ride.

However, is this enough to make task tracking seamless that I'll actually do it? There's only one way
to find out and that is to try it.

# Summary

Having a feedback loop with everything you do is incredibly important. Without feedback you might as
well be doing a random walk. Use the feedback to work on the most important problems. Minimize
iteration time to spend as much time in the feedback loop as possible.
