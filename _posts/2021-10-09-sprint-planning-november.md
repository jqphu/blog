## Retrospective for September:

Well, goals are hard :).

## [P1] KR: Exercise for at least 15 minutes daily

Didn't really get into yoga so exercise wasn't great. However, I did play a ton of tennis! I've been
feeling better about my tennis skills.

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block

Work was pretty crazy last month. Lots of different things taking my attention. It was good staying
a float but not enough deep work!

## Plan for October

## [P1] KR: Become a solid 3.5 low 4.0 rated tennis player

Tennis :) - I joined three leagues for this month (two singles, one doubles). Let's kick ass :D

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block

Simple - let's get control back over our time.
