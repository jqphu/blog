title: Give Me Your Attention

This type of day seems almost normal in the 21st century. We mindlessly go through the motions of
life stuck in an endless cycle unaware of the ramifications that may come of our actions. We live in
a world of instant gratification. A funny TikTok video gives us that little jump of serotonin
forcing us to continue scrolling to find that next video that will give us our fix. We are addicted.

# Why is this bad?

In this attention economy we live in everyone wants a piece of your time. This makes the internet
reward smaller and smaller pieces of information to get you hooked. Our attention spans are
shrinking drastically - videos are getting shorter and shorter, articles focusing more on
click-bait. This behavior is evident in the workplace, open plan offices and instant messaging
applications (Slack) whilst having their benefits they optimize for a quick short solution. The
barrier to messaging someone to ask how to do something is much smaller than sitting and struggling
for the next 10 minutes.

The cost of this is two fold:
* Cost of context switching
* Inability to focus deeply on problems

## Context Switching

For those familiar with Operating Systems one of the key concepts is to minimize context switching.
The reason for this is during a context switch you need to save all the information of the old
context and load all the new information. The old information was fresh and easily accessible but by
switching to a different task all of those advantages are gone. Try to remember a few sentences from
this blog. Work on something else for 10 minutes and try to recall the same passage. The brain will
flush out unnecessary information fairly quickly.

A large amount of context switching leads to the feeling of being busy without making any progress.
Most of the time is spent paging in old knowledge about the problem rather than figuring out ways to
solve the problem at hand.

## Focus Deeply

The only way to improve is to push yourself right to your limit. Reaching this limit should be
uncomfortable but should not be hard enough that you give up. This is the zone you want to stay in
to grow. Every time your attention diverges you pull yourself further and further away from this
limit.

## Analogy
Consider the goal of getting stronger. If you decide to do one push up and then take a 30 minute
break over the course of a day you'll likely see little to no improvements. However, if you combine
all of those push ups into one session pushing yourself near maximal load you will proceed to see
far more strength gains.

# How to Reclaim Your Attention

I'm not going to be a click bait blog and tell you "here are the 3 things you need to do to reclaim
your attention (CLICK HERE)!!!!!" but I will go through some techniques I am trying to employ
myself. Being aware of the problem is the first step then proceeding to experiment with solutions is
always my methodology.

The two techniques I am going to talk about are:
* Carving out deep work time
* Set up a routine

# Deep Work 

Heavily influenced by Cal Newport's [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), I have
made sure to carve out time for deep work to enter the Growth Zone and stay there for as long as
possible. The technique I use is what works for me and my job. Be sure to play around with the
frequency and length of your deep work blocks. 

To ensure I don't get distracted I block out two to three hours of time at Work for my Deep Work.
During this time I do not respond to messages, emails or even look at my phone. Before you say "but
when I get a ping I need to urgently respond!", I'd say give this a shot. You'll be suprised as to
how many messages aren't really urgent and in fact if you leave messages for a while they might even
resolve themselves. That said don't blindly do this, be sure to communicate with your colleagues that
this is a time where you'll be focusing.

However, carving out a deep work block is not enough. One thing that I've learnt is ensure the
environment is ideal to facilitate deep work. In fact I have a play book that I execute before I
enter a Deep Work stage. It looks like the following:

> Go through these steps to prepare:
> 
> Food:
> * Prepare Snacks/Fruit - Go eat if you're hungry.
> 
> Water:
> * Refill Water/Tea etc
> 
> Physical Environment:
> * Clean Desk - Only essentials
> * Move phone out of office.
> 
> Desktop
> * Close all email/messenger/workplace
> * Close all un-needed tabs and terminals (clear the workspace)
> 
> Goal
> * Write out a well defined goal for the deep work session.
> 
> Walk
> * Take a brisk 5 minute walk, go to the bathroom, wash your face.
> * Visualize what a success hour looks like on this miniature break.

Whilst within a Deep Work session when you feel the desire to jump onto your phone or get distracted
recognize that you may be getting overwhelmed. The best solution is to get some air, go for a walk,
relax a little. The mind will be processing the information in the background so ensure you don't
overwrite that information by going on your phone.

# Routine

With a large portion of the population working from home it is easy to blur the lines between Work
and Home. We can find ourselves being drawn into the issues at work and since starting work is often
only a few steps away we can't help but jump right in. This is where a routine is the utmost
importance. It helps you give your attention to things that matter as opposed to whatever is the
more urgent issue at hand. It allows you to invest your time in activities that may not have an
instant gratification but will be worth it in the long run. 

Let me put a disclaimer here to say I've never been very good with sticking to my routine. I'm still
experimenting to find what works but let's break down my current routine.

> ### 6:00am - 7:00am
> * Wake-up 
> * Chug a glass of water.
>   * Great way to wake up and re-hydrate the body.
> * Blue Light + 30 Starjumps
>   * Signal to the body that it is morning!
> * Meditate
>   * This is a practice I have been very inconsistent with but I will keep on trying!
> * Coffee
>   * The first week of each month is decaf to help bring my caffeine tolerance down.
> * Journal
>   * 3 things I'm grateful for
>   * 3 small things that will make this day amazing
>   * Anything that is on my mind.
> 
> ### 7:00am - 9:00am
> * M\|W\|F - Exercise
>   * Tennis, Gym (when it is open), Run, etc
> * Tu\|Th - Working on my own things.
>   * Habit tracker, Watch a Lecture, Blog etc
>   * On these days, once I'm done with my own work I'll go for a walk around the block to mimic
>     "walking to work" and then come back home.
> * Sa\|Su - Exercise \| Working on my own things.
>   * Flexible depending on whether tennis partner is available etc
> 
> ### 9:00am - 5:00pm
> * Cold shower!
>   * Be comfortable with uncomfortable.
> 
> ### 5:00pm - 5:30pm
> * Eat + Misc Social Media Scrolling :P
> 
> ### 5:30pm - 7:30pm
> * Mo \| Tu \| Th \| Fr  Habit Tracker Programming
>   * Trying to learn something new :)
> 
> ### 8:00pm -> Sleep
> * Journal
>   * Reflect on the day
>   * What went well, what could have gone better!
>   * Whatever is on my mind.
> * Prepare for tomorrow!
>   * Coffee Machine / Kettle
>   * Prepare clothes (Work + Workout Clothes)
>   * Clean working environment (start the morning strong!)
> * Read / Relax / Cut out devices at this point.

The important steps are the beginning and end of the day. These are the anchors of the day to ensure
you spend times on things you determine are valuable but might not repeat immediate rewards. The
work day is intentionally left as one big block to handle the reactive nature of the job.

By intentionally specifying things like morning exercises and afternoon programming I am able to
separate when I'm at "home" and at "work" to ensure there is some sort of separation.

The main rationale of this blog post was to be more accountable with my routine and habits but I
hope you found something useful :).

If you reached the end and read the whole post - reach out to me and we can get a coffee (a
virtual one until COVID blows over :D).
