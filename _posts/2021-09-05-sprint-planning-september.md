Two goals for September:

## [P1] KR: Exercise for at least 15 minutes daily
* I want to do some early morning yoga! 30 days of yoga Matt D'avella style!

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block
* Now I have a focused goal. Let's turn off all notifications for the first half of the day. Sit
  down and get things done!
