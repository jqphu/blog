A little late to this planning :P. Let's keep it short and sweet!

## [P0] KR: Mindless is used to reflect on OKRs and Sprints
* Work on mindless on the next two Sundays.
  * Get enough to start tracking work hours is a good start.

## [P1] KR: Read a book a month.
* Finish reading "How to take smart notes." 

## [P1] KR: Write a post every two weeks.
* Write about how we've implemented "How to take smart notes"
* Write about planning :)

## [P1] KR: Compete in a tennis tournament
* Kick start searching for a coach
* Get more consistent with tennis practice 

## [P1] KR: Work less than 50 hours a week.
* Start figuring a method to measure this (mindless? :)). Have shutdown and start routines.
