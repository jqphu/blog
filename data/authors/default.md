Finally made it back to the bay, just patiently waiting for the sun to come back.
Found a nice 5bd apartment to live with my co-founder and friends. We're always happy to have people come stay for a while.

## 🔨 Hunkering down in the bear market and building
Building [Pocket Universe](https://pocketuniverse.app) and trying to keep people in crypto safe from scams! I'm certain this will be crucial in the future of crypto just navigating what the best form factor for this product is. Also looking to grow the team a little.

It's fulfilling being able to save people money and shipping a product that users find valuable!

Bear market is definitely tough as the number of users in crypto are dwindling and there seem to be very few real use-cases outside of speculation. I'm overall still bullish on crypto but need to find conviction on what direction it takes.

## 🎾 Playing tennis semi-competitively

Been playing tennis 2-3 times a week consistently. Recently got a ball machine which I've been trying to put more into my schedule.

I upgraded my tennis rating from 3.5 USTA to 4.0 USTA despite still not having a singles USTA win under my belt. I'll get my first win this year!

Playing the UTR flex league starting next month as well as signing up for a few tournaments.

## 🏋️ Bringing back my old goal of reaching 1000lb total (that's my 1 rep max of bench, squat and deadlift totaling over 1000lbs)

Purchased a simple home gym setup in our backyard. I'm doing 5/3/1 for beginners in the hopes of getting back to reaching the elusive 1000lb total. Going to remind myself to start off slow and not injure myself. Slow progress is better than no progress.

## 🧘 Yoga and rehab

I've done Yoga 45 times in the last 60 days! Trying to do it once every second day to help improve flexibility. My knees have been hurting from playing a bit too much tennis and not strengthening the body. Hoping to be a little more all rounded with my strength.
