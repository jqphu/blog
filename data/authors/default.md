## Location: Canggu, Bali
Enjoying the sunshine and delicious food in Bali! Hunkering down here for the next two months and
building.

## Career
Jumped into the deep end and decided to start my own company! Do I know what I'm doing? Absolutely
not. Will I figure it out? Definitely! We're called Refract and have been exploring the web3 space.

I finally shipped a product into the real world which makes me happy. [sendthnx.com](https://sendthnx.com) was a small project we did.

Exploring web3 to find a meatier problem.

## Learning
Back to learning and doing the [Macro engineering fellowship](https://0xmacro.notion.site/Welcome-to-Macro-Engineering-Fellowship-Pre-course-65d29f4193ba4461bf5ff30441c3a9a3). Getting deep into the weeds of Ethereum.

## EVM
Working on a Rust EVM implementation. Open source soon... It's super neat that there are heaps of
test cases to run it through.

## Smart Contract Wallets
A recent interest has been in creating better ways to do transactions. Examples include:
  * 2fa approval of transactions
  * creating a pay me link so you don't typo addresses
  * withdrawal limits etc

All of these seems like what we'd want to have in the future!

## Tennis
I have not played for the last 6 months but looking to get back into it here in Bali. Hopefully I
can get some coaching and play in some tournaments.
