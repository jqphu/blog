## Sydney? Bay Area? Unknown?
Currently back at home in Sydney, Australia for the next month or so. Enjoying my time with my
family and friends. Don't quite know where I'm going to live in the next few years. Maybe back to
the bay, maybe in Sydney, maybe somewhere I don't even know yet! Let's find out.

## Career
[*Making the world a better place*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso) at Facebook, I
mean, [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/meta/).

On a serious note, I'm at the first intersection in my career. Pivoting to something... I'm just not
exactly sure what yet. Everything is up in the air from domain to company. Web3? AR? Meta? Google?
It is both exciting and incredibly terrifying.

All I know now is it's time to find the [next hill to climb](https://cdixon.org/2009/09/19/climbing-the-wrong-hill).

## Tech

### Web3
A huge gigantic fad or the next generation of compute. I have no idea but I'm particularly
interested in participating and finding out. Fascinated by the concept of a decentralized and open
state machine. Ethereum and Solana have my interest. I am explicitly *not* interested in the finance
side. I think it's fascinating but not what I want to build for. Protocols facilitating increase
composability I can get around.

### Rust
Learning more and more Rust! I need a meatier project to write some more code. Starting on [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) in Rust [here](https://gitlab.com/justinqphu/crafting_interpreters).

## Tennis
Officially rated as a 3.5 tennis player. 4.0 is around the corner. Trying to play tennis 3x a week
but currently on holiday ðŸ’¤. Hoping to attend Australian Open 2022 and see Nadal. Looking to enter some tournaments!

## Build
Lastly, but definitely not least I'm refocusing from learning to building. I've done a ton of
learning, reading and talking but not enough building. It's time to get my hands dirtier and do
something!
