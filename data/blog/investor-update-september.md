Hey everyone!

It feels wild that only a month has passed. So much has been going on! Let's dig in.

Here are our KPIs:

## KPIs
* Weekly Active 3370 (+204% m/m)
* 7 day retention - 77.93%
* Costs: ~$2000 monthly

## What  do we need help with
* **Introductions to Wallets**: This is our primary focus, warm intros would be greatly appreciated.

## Since Last Time
* Launched 5+ new security features.
* Running all simulations on our own infrastructure
* Launched a free coverage program to early adopters. Covers up to $250 of lost assets! 1000 people have claimed this.

## The Good News
* People enjoy the product and we're protecting people from scams!
    * Messaged 1000 of our followers from twitter. From the 121 responses who used the product, 57% of them would be very disappointed if the extension disappeared and 33% would be slightly disappointed.
    * Receiving feedback and tweets that we've saved people from scams!
* New Infrastructure is stable and ready to scale
    * Our extrapolated costs for the simulation service we were using would have exceeded $10 000. We can now do it at a fraction of the price.
    * We have proven with our new architecture we can simulate **every single Ethereum transaction**.

## The Not So Good News
* Figuring out monetization 
    * The mission is to keep as many people safe as possible. We really want to avoid charging people for security. We're still exploring different mechanisms to monetize.

## Goals for September
* Start having revenue
* Decide whether to focus on the extension or the API
    * Currently we're working on the simulation API offering in tandem with developing the extension. By the end of the month we'll have one path we're focusing on.

## Something Fun
This is my pair programmer. He has been keeping me company :).

Onwards to another great month!

Kind regards,
Justin Phu
