# Summary

Goals of the sprint were:
## [P0] Key Result 1: Develop a consistent sleeping pattern
## [P0] Key Result 1: Mindless Project Development
## [P1] Key Result 2: Morning and Night Routines
## [P1] Key Result 2: Ruthlessly Prioritize

Didn't really focus much on my goal this month. Sleep and exercise tanked as the holiday season came
in. I guess it was the holiday season and I was missing home / people. 

A month to recharge. Onwards to the new year!
