## Notes
* The last month of planning! Let's set some attainable goals :P
* Tennis league this month!
* Still pending trip to Australia - flight are expensive and I'll still have to quarantine :(. TBD.
* Let's end the half with some wins!

## [P0] KR: Mindless is used to reflect on OKRs and Sprints
* Keep using Mindless :P

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block
* Focus! Take this time seriously. Do *not* talk to anyone during this time.

## [P1] KR: Compete in a tennis tournament
* Let's do it! Even if we lose every match :P

## [P1] KR: Sleep score >80 and Readiness Score >80.
* We're so close! Let's focus on sleeping on time and not staying up late.

## [P1] KR: 90 sessions of meditation.
* We won't hit 90 but I'll take another 30 :)

## [P1] KR: Write a post every two weeks.
* Keep writing!

Surprisingly, if we hit the above KRs we will have hit a majority of our goals!
