It's that time of the year again! 1.5 month late, oops.

We're going to do something slightly different. We're going to consider simply extending and
modifying the goals in 2021H1. I think they were set out well and the goals and north star remains
almost identical.

A slight deviation to help us with execution is to focus a little bit more on process outcomes as
opposed to concrete goals. This is going to be a tricky balance because I need to focus on seeing
something through to the end but I shouldn't stop myself from exploring.

A lot of this will simply be copy and paste plus more simplification :).

# Objective 1: Learning

> Being able to explain and excite others about various ideas and concepts.

## [P0] KR: Spend 6 hours a week on your own learning by the last month.
  * We intentionally keep this open to allow for flexibility. This can range from Mindless, working
    on my magic mirror, doing courses (Probabilistic Graphical Models), etc.
  * Ideally, this is a habit that's done once a day (1h - 1.5h) and I do hope we spend time on
    Mindless but let's leave that up to the monthly sprint plannings.

# Objective 2: Foundation

> Feeling effortless when it comes to habits and health.

## [P1] KR: Become a solid 3.5 low 4.0 rated tennis player
  * I am currently low 3.5 based on tennis record. If I play some more tournament's or leagues
    hopefully I can use tennis record as my measurement. Otherwise, I'll just guess.

## [P1] KR: Exercise for at least 15 minutes daily
  * I'm currently playing tennis 3 times a week which is great! However, I want to do some small
    exercise every single day. Morning walk, yoga, etc. 

# Objective 3: Work

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block
* Have at least **one** focus block per day to get the hard things done and develop.
