## Metrics
* Sleep Score - 78
* Activity Score - 79 
* Readiness Score - 77

* Meditation Sessions - ~10 (ish? We're on session 24 but have been doing it in April)
* Books read this month - 0
* Deep work blocks - ???

## What Went Well

* Sleep score and readiness score are improving!
* Tennis is continuing and I am improving :)
* Meditation felt like it was being focused (but I guess I only did 10 sessions).
* Finally got Mindless APP to a state that it works and stores state in a persistent way. Though,
  have yet to use it consistently.
* Did the MSF course so I can get my motorcycle license :D
  
## What Could Be Improved
* One word - GME.
  * This world of stocks, squeezes and options consumed a lot of my time. I sure learnt a lot and
    also lost a lot of money :).
* Exercise other than tennis (gym, cardio, anything).

## Action items
Not sure :o. Need to stop watching the GME ticker and focusing on deep work blocks.

* I am going to try find an accountability partner to help push through this month.

## Review

## [P0] KR: Have a daily deep work block
* I definitely have deep work blocks blocked out on my calendar. Still hard to tell how often I'm
  doing it :(. Really need to take this super seriously!

## [P0] KR: Mindless is used to reflect on OKRs and Sprints
* Eh, had a few lazy weekends. Did spend one weekend on it getting it running though!

## [P1] KR: Read a book a month.
* ??? the only thing I have been reading is GME

## [P1] KR: 90 sessions of meditation.
* Did a little better but still not very consistent. I'll go on a streak then forget about it.
