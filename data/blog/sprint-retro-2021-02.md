## Metrics
* Sleep Score - 76
* Activity Score - 79 
* Readiness Score - 75

* Meditation Sessions - 10
* Books read this month - 1
* Deep work blocks - half of work days?

## What Went Well

* Maintaining relationships w/people in Australia and in the bay. Staying sane  :) 
* Haven't entirely given up on tennis yet.
* Adult things
  * Got money in order. Student loans paid so we're debt free! Finished filing some overdue tax
  returns. Figured out some basic 401k, backdoor, mega backdoor things.
  * Therapy has helped be a little more mindful. Trying to practice being flexible mentally and
  understand where extremes aren't beneficial. Probably finishing it up but was an interesting
  experience! 
  * Physical Therapy!
  * New glasses & Contacts
* Promotion!
  * Although, that wasn't a result of the work I did during this month but rather the work I put in
    6 months ago :P.
* Metrics slightly higher! Trending in the right direction.
* Morning and Night Routine.
  
## What Could Be Improved
* Need to get more focused with work x2. Deep blocks. Remember to focus thinking on long term and
  everything fits in naturally.
* Too much work and not enough habits - as always :P.
* No Mindless.

## Action items
* Focus next retrospective on habits O_O 

## Review

## [P0] KR: Mindless is used to reflect on OKRs and Sprints
  * Spend one weekend on mindless.

## [P1] KR: Read a book a month
* Finished reading how to take smart notes.
  * Somehow I finished more books than I read.

## [P1] KR: Write a post every two weeks.
* 0 for now but maybe I'll get a quick one out tomorrow!

## [P1] KR: Compete in a tennis tournament
* Hit ~8 sessions of tennis! Nice job.
* Did ~2 sessions of yoga :(

## [P1] KR: Work less than 50 hours a week.
* Started tracking morning and night stats. Still working too much in absolute numbers (I get
  distracted during work so by cutting down absolute numbers doesn't mean I'll do less work.)
