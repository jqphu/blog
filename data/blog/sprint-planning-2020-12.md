Last month of the year and what a year it has been!

# Events
* Back to purple tier for COVID - Gyms closed again.

# H2 Schedule Overall
The last month! Let's take a quick glance at the P0s for this half and see where we stand.

Done:

* [P0] Key Result 1: Exercise
  * This key result I believe is done - the routine has been consistent (barring my injury) for the past
few months. We should maintain this :)

* [P0] Key Result 1: Execute on Critical Features
  * I'm happy to mark this as done! We still have one or two more items we want to get done but we
    have focused on the major items.

At risk:

* [P0] Key Result 1: Develop a consistent sleeping pattern
  * I thought this was going on track, but last month showed it is back to the risk category. It is
    too volatile! Let's see if we can hit our goal of waking up within 1 hour of the specified time
    for December.

* [P0] Key Result 1: Mindless Project Development
  * This is at a pretty huge risk. We need to have something that we are happy to use. It will take
    a little over a miracle to get this done :)

Falling out:

* [P0] Key Result 2: Mindless Project Consistency
  * This has simply fallen out. This was assumed to be tied with the above KR but consistent focus
    was not there.

# Sprint KRs

This sprint is going to be incredibly simple. We will have 4 goals in order of priority.

## [P0] Key Result 1: Develop a consistent sleeping pattern

Sleep is the foundation! We will spent all our mental energy getting our sleeping habits in place.

**Success Criteria: Wake-up within 1 hour of 5am daily**

## [P0] Key Result 1: Mindless Project Development

We can't continue to ignore this, it is one of the most high value items but in the lowest bucket in
terms of priority.

I don't think we will hit the goals of getting something friends can use daily but something we can
use should in be in order.

**Success Criteria: Have a product you are happy to use daily.**

**System: Every Saturday is spent on Mindless.**

We may do more, depending on the week and how our goals go but this is a minimum requirement.
Frankly, I don't think it's that hard. 1 week of solid work and I could get this done, so I will
spread that over 4 Saturdays and a few additional hours here and there.

## [P1] Key Result 2: Morning and Night Routines

We have routines in place, it's time to get a little more serious about them. They've been going
reasonable well but let's try to execute this month.

**Success Criteria: Follow the night routine daily.**


## [P1] Key Result 2: Ruthlessly Prioritize

Continue with deep work scheduled blocks at work. Be flexible, but have at least one proper deep
work block a day (at least 1 hour).

**Success Criteria: A deep work block every workday.**

# Summary

If we hit these, it will put us in a good place. However, this won't be easy - a lot of these KRs
have been repeated before but failed to be completed. Let's end 2020 with a bang!
