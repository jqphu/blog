Hey all,

It's been a busy and exciting month for Refract. Our goal last month was to ship and we did exactly that 2 weeks ago - [pocketuniverse.app](https://pocketuniverse.app).  We shipped a chrome extension that simulates transactions to see what assets have changed before you sign it in MetaMask. By doing so you can clearly see if a transaction you're about to sign is going to take all your NFTs!

Here are our KPIS:

## KPIs
* 451 Daily Active Users
* 1183 Weekly Active Users
* 7 day retention - 63.72% (average 47 users). This data is very early so we don't index on it highly.
* Current Costs - $1100 USD Monthly but growing fast.

## What do we need help with
* **Introduction to teams developing wallets** - We are gearing up to partner with wallets to provide our simulations as a service. We've been in talks with MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and others but would love to chat to more people.

## The Good News
* 1000+ weekly users ðŸ¥³.
* Signed a engagement letter with a wallet that is ideally shipping in early September.
* Partnership with Zeneca, FMC, Rekt-Collective and others who helped us reach a much wider audience.

## The Not So Good News
* A week ago MetaMask improved their UI around the specific scam we are currently most focused on preventing (scams that call setApprovalForAll and drain all your NFTs).
    * Mitigation: We suspect scammers will continue to adapt and we're investigating more safeguards to help all web3 users.
* Costs are starting to increase. We're leveraging Tenderly for simulations and have been upgrading our plan every week. This will be a show stopper if we want to serve everyone in web3.
    * Mitigation: I believe we should be able to simulate **every single Ethereum transaction** for under $1000 USD a month. We're going to bring the simulations inhouse to remove our dependency on Tenderly and prepare for the upcoming wallet integration.

## Goals for August
* Ship with wallets.
    * Scale the simulations.
    * Build the SDK.
    * Integrate.
* Validate other security focused consumer facing features.
    * Whitelisting contracts for mints.
    * Detecting potentially stolen NFTs and flagging them.

## Something fun 
Nish and I tried hot yoga for the first time. Doing yoga is hard. Doing yoga in a steaming room with sweat dripping down your face is extra hard. It was super fun though and we're going to try to keep it in our routine!

## Something learnt
Talking to every single person that follows us on Twitter is an effective strategy to learn more about our customers!


Btw, Bali is beautiful :)

Though we are going to need to improve our working setup :P. I need more monitors and Nish needs a better standing desk!

That's all for this month!

Kind regards,
