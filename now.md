# Projects

Building a new operating system at Facebook Reality Labs! Learning from incredible people and having
fun along the way.

Still working on random projects from time to time. Eventually I'll finish [Mindless](Mindless)...

# Balance

Figuring out how to balance my life with healthy habits. Experimenting with different sleep
patterns, routines and exercises. I want to be physically and mentally fit!

Finding out what's gives me [energy](https://blog.justinphu.dev/2021/08/28/think-energy-not-time/) and what drains me.

# Bay Area

Living the COVID lockdown life in the bay. Trying to find my tribe. Continuing to learn from
everyone around me!

# Tennis

Working towards being the next tennis star! I have been playing 3x a week for the past year. I still
suck though :'( (NTRP rating: 3.5).

# Vision

Continuing to explore how I'm going to change the world. If you have any world shattering ideas let me know :).
